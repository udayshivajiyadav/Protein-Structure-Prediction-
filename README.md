# Protein-Structure-Prediction-
This program is an explainable protein structure prediction web application built with Streamlit. It allows a user to input an amino-acid sequence, validates that sequence, runs a transformer-based protein folding model (ESMFold) to predict the 3D structure, and then presents both the predicted structure and model internals in an interpretable way.
